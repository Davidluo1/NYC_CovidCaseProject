            <h1>NYC Covid Data Map</h1>

            <p> We have experienced the impact of Covid virus for more than a year. In New York, people 
                are getting "used" to live under this environment, I could see fair amount of people stopped 
                wearing mask going outside and eating normally in restaurant. From the data I gathered from 
                NYC open data, I could tell there is still a significant increase of covid cases weekly.
            </p>
            <p> From the data chart above, we can see the portion of covid weekly cases between boroughs. 
                Staten Island have the lowest cases increase, and Queens have the highest cases increase. 
                From these charts, you can have better understand on the covid situation around these borough 
                and make better precautions.

            <p> From the data chart above, it is clearly that Queens and Manhattan has the highest Covid 
                Case increase rate, Staten Island has the lowest.
