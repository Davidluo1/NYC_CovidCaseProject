            <p>This plot data visualization above indicates the number of Covid case increase per week in x dates. From this graph, I can tell there is a little re-bounce right after Nov for all boroughs. It provides a very strong signal that we need to be cautious going outdoors. </p>

            <h2>Covid Hospital Cases</h2>
            <img src="image/Covid_Hospital_Cases.png" alt="Hospital Cases" height=500 width=500>
            <p>This plot data visualization above indicates the number of hospitalized cases increase per week in x dates. Everyone knows what hospital like in New York, it is a big pain to wait hours before any treatment. From this graph, it sort of tells me the amount of work each boroughsâ€™ hospital has, so I know when the hospital is not that busy. </p>

            <h2>Covid All Cases</h2>
            <p>This plot data visualization above indicates the number of total Covid cases occurred in x dates. From this graph, I can identify the trend by comparing each borough in NYC. It may be hard to tell but it seems like that Brooklyn has the highest number of Covid cases, and Staten Island has the lowest. I can also tell the number of Covid cases in all boroughs increased significantly through Aug to mid-Sep, and dropped after Oct. </p>
